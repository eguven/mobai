# MOBAI

A very simple moba inspired game engine intended to be used as a framework for
AI playground and bot training.

**Project is still in early development**, see [docs/](https://github.com/eguven/mobai/tree/master/docs) for documentation.

### Status

* engine: alpha
* runner: pre-alpha
* server: planning

### Roadmap

* complete game server that can queue players, create and run games
* engine improvements
    * Map: complex, perhaps procedurally generated maps
    * Map: 8-directional movement
    * Units: More types of units
    * Game: Some game progress mechanism (like gold/xp in MOBA games) and a way to make use of it
